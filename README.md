Rusty Bargain – Car Price Prediction App (Model Benchmarking & Optimization)


**Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict used car market value, balancing accuracy, speed, and training time.**

- Cleaned and encoded historical car data, handled missing values by imputation and mode-based logic, and scaled numeric features.
- Trained and compared multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost) using RMSE, training time, and inference speed as criteria.
- Achieved best performance with a tuned LightGBM model (RMSE ≈ 1722), significantly outperforming baseline models in both accuracy and prediction efficiency.
